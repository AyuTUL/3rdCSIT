drawbacks of newton rpahson:
-requires derivative
-poor initial guess leads to divergence/convergence to
wrong root
-if dx=0 method wont work due to div by 0
-may not converge for function with steep inflection point
-not guarantee to find root unless guess is close

regression vs interpolation
regression			interpolation
approximate a best fix to data	exact fit through all data points
degree of polynomial is low	degree=no. of points -1
doesnt pass through all points	pass through all points
noisy/overdetermined data	exact value/small data points

pivoting:
reaaranging the rows/columns of a matrix to largest
non-zero element called pivot in pivot(diagonal elment)
position
-avoids /0
-reduces rounding error by avoidiong very small divison
-works for convergeance in ill conditioned systems

gauss elim vs gauss jordan
gauss elim			gauss jordan
forwards elim + back substitue	forward elimination+ reduce to I matrix
row echelon form		reduced row echelon form
upper triangular matrix		identity matrix
computaiton cost is less	more
easy for large system		complex
solving system of eqns		inverse of matrix
