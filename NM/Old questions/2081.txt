inherent erros:
arrise naturally due to limitation of method itself
unavoidable and can only be elimninated
-truncation,round off,discretization,algorithmic,propagation error

limitations of direct methods
-computational cost:longer time complexity so expensive for large systems
-memory usage: requires storing all coefficaints and intermddiate results
-numerical instabiulity: small round off erros during elimination can
accumulate especially in ill conditioned system leading to inaccurate 
results
-lack of scalability: not suitale for very large/sparse systems
-poor paralleliation: due to sequential dependecy in row operations

jacobi vs gauss seidel:
jacobi				gauss seidel
uses only previuos iteration	uses newly computed valeus immediately
values for all variables
convergence slower		convewrgence faster
easy to paralleize(all updates	harder(updates are dependent
are independent)
requires storing both old and	can overwarite values(less memory usage)
new values


regression analysis:
process of finding relationship between dependent & independent variable
to predict vaclue of dependent based in inde[pendet
understand how change in independent affets dependent
model trends/pattern in data
use: forecasting sales/weather,risk assessment,machine learning AI

numerical differentation:
fiding appropximate derivative of function using numerical technique
required when:
-functional values are known but function is unkonw(tabulate dfunctions)
-function to be diferentiated is complciated
Ill Conditioned Systems

numerical integratoin:
process of fidning integration of a function using set of tabulated data
use:
engineering: area under stress strain curves to calculate work done
,velocity time data
economics:area under demand curve
population:integrate birth/death rate functions to predict future popn
iamge processing:compute surface area and voolume from scanned image data

What is differential equation? Differentiate between ODE and PDE with example.
DE is eqn that uses derivates to exrepss realtionship between depednent
and indepenedent variables.eg:modeling real world phenomena like heat,
fluid flow popn growth
ODE vs PDE:
ODE				PDE
contains derivatives wrt to 1 x	contains derivatives wrt 2/more x
