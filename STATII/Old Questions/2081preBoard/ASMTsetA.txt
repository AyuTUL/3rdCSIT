1. Explain the purpose of applying multiple linear analysis?
to understand the relationship between 1 dependent y and 2/more independent x variables
-prediction: predict value of y based on known values of x eg house price based on size age
-relationship: how much each x contributes to y eg: how much advertising budget rating affect sales
-control for confounding variables: isolate effect of each x controlling influence of others
-testing hypothesis: theorize how variables are related
-modling real world situations: real world outcoems are raely influenced by just one factor, realistic accurate

2. Assumptions involed in t test for testing significant difference ebtween 2 sample means(paired t test)
-dependent variable is continuous (interval/ratio scale data)
-sample must be related/dependent
-random sample of data
-difference between paired values must be approximately normally distributed
- no outliers in the difference between 2 related groups
