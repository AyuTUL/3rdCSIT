linear model of lsd:
yijk=mu+alpha i + beta j + gamm k + eijk
yijk:obs in ith row jth column kth treatment
alpha i:efffect duee to ith row level of blocking factor
beta j: effect due to jth lelve of colkmun blocking factor
gammak: effect due to kth level of primary factor
eijk:random error whichi is normally distributed with mean0 and variance sig2

markov chain:
stochastic process that undergoes transition from one state to another
in a state spacce where the probability of moving to next state depends 
only on current state and not previous

properties:
-markov property:
future state depends oon only current state not sequqnce of events before
-stae space:
can be finite or countably infiinte
-inital distribution:
specifies probability of s tarting in each state
-stationary didstribution:
probability distribtuion pi uch taht piP=pi
represent long term behaviour of chain

why use non parametric test:
