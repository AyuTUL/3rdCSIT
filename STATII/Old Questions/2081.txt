purpose of mutiple linear regression:
liaer relationship between one dependent vairable and 2/more
indepenent variable
varaibles
-prediction: estimate value of y based on known vlues of x
-explaantion: understand value and significance of each x
-control for confounding: adjust other factors to isolate effect
of particular x
-model complex relationship: capture itneraction and non linnear
trends

assumptions involed in t test for testing significant 
difference ebtween 2 sample means(paired t test)
-dependent variable is continuous (interval/ratio scale data)
-sample must be related/dependent
-random sample of data
-difference between paired values must be approximately normally distributed
- no outliers in the difference between 2 related groups

design of experiment:
statsitacal methdo of planning expermienst in a way data can be
analyzed to yield valid and object concluse:
-idinetify cause and effect relatiuonship bewteen varaibles
-minimize varailbilty,maziminize information
-optimize porcess/products
randomizaiton,replicaion,blocking

lsd:
experimental design which has capacitiy to handle 2 knowwn nuisance
source of variablity imultaneously as 2 indeoedent blocking criteria
each trreamenet occurs once in each row and each column
no. of treatmenets=no.of replicaiotns

Explain why the number of treatments tested in a Latin Square Design
 should not be less than 3?
prevent df to be -ve or zero
balance treatm one  per ow column
control varaivlity

confidence level:
probability that interval estimate will contain the paramener theta
1-alpha

partial cooreation coeff:
meausres relation between 2 varaibles whjile controlling effect of 
1/more varaibles
isolates direct association between 2 variables by removing effect
of confounding variables
1st 2nd 3rd o rder(controlled effect of 1,2,3/more var)

multiple cororelkation coeff:
closesness of assocaiton between obsdervue dof depoend variale y and
its estimated value y cap given by regreesion eqn
Ry.12
perasion's correlation coeff between y and y cap

significance level in hypothesis testing:
error of rejecting null hypothesis when it is true is type I error
probability of makling type 1 error is called siginifance level
alpha=prob(reject H0/H0 true)

queuing theory:
queuins system in context of stochastic process is a mathematical
model used tod escribe systems in which entities arrive randomyl
over time and wait in a queue to be served by 1/more servers
eg: waiting for bus,waiting in supermarkets,fast food drive thorugh

components:
-arrival prccoess:
describes fhow entities arrive at queueing system
time betweeen arrivals are assumed to be random,commonly poisson

-queueing & routing to servers:
queue is where enntites wait for their turn at service faicilty

-server mehcanism:
how customers are served after joining a queue

-queue discipline:
rule by which entities in queu are selected for service
FIFO LIFO priorty

-departure:
once service is complete, entities exit the system
may include post service feedback

clt:
statistical concept that states that sample mean distribution of a 
random vraiable appraches normal distribtuin as sample size increaes
regardless of shape of original poluation distribution
sample size>=30
average of sample mean and sd is will be eual to popn mean and sd
