circular queue:
improvement upon linear queue in which the two ends of the queue are conencted through a 
pointer where the very first element comes after hte last element making a circle
-follows fifo
-2 pointers rear and front
-if rear reaches end, then goes back to 0 if there is space
-CPU scheduling(round robin), multiplayer games(after last player, first players turn again)
traffic lights(round robin)

drawbacks of linear queue:
in linear queue, once the queue is completely full, it isnt possible to insert more elements
even if elements are dequeued, elements cant be inserted in dequeued space until full reset
figure f | 1 2 3 4 | r dequeue |    f 4 |
whene we dequeue elemnt, we are only moving the front of queue forward not actually craeting free space. the new element to be inserted still has to be inserted from the rear but rear pointer is still at end of queue.
circular queue reuses empty spaces created by earlier dequeues circular queue figure

stack vs queue:
stack				queue
lifo				fifo
push pop			enqueue dequeue
top pointer			front rear pointers
undo history book stack	printer queue ticket line
no types			linear circular doubly circular doubly
function call backtracking	scheduling buffer handling

avl tree:
type of height balanced binary tree developed by GM adel'son Vel'sky and EM Landis
a binary tree is called balanced if height of left and right children of each node differs
by either 1 0 -1 (balance factor=height of keft sub tree - height of right subtree)
if after insertion/deletion tree becomes unblanced, rotations(single/double) are performed
to balance it

heap vs tree:
heap					tree
specialized complete binary tree	general heirarchical structure
always complete 			can be skewedd/balanced
parent node is>=max heap of <=min heap	in BST, left<root<right
fast acccess to max/min element		organize and search elements efficiently
priotirty queue				BST,AVL tree

list:
ADT in which elements are stored in ordered manenr for easy and efficient retrieval
array stores only homogenous data but list can store heterogeneous data
list1=[1,2,3] list2=[1,'a',"koko","moko"]
static(Array) dynamic(linked list)

stack using linked list:
when stack is implemented using array, its size has to be known in advance and cant be changed at run time. but if implemeneted using linked list, it works for unlimited no. of elements. figure

circular linked list:
last node of linked list points to first making a circle
no NULL in next part of any node
first node is called first and last node is called last
figure 

A+(((B-C)*(D-E)+F)/G)$(H-I) into postfix
if precedence same, check associativity, if LTR pop
ABC-DE-*F+G/HI-$+

MST:
spanning tree is sub graph of a graph that connects all vertices of original graph without forming a cycle
total no. of spanning trees = n^(n-2)
among all the spanning tress of a weighted connected graph, the spanning tree with the least total edge weight is called MST

shell sort:
breaks the list into sub lists using interval called gap then sorts the sub lists using insertion sort
