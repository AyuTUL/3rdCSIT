A non-linear equation is an equation in which the variables do not 
appear only to the first power and are not simply added or multiplied 
by constants.

Matrix factorization (or decomposition) is the process of expressing 
a matrix as a product of two or more simpler matrices, often to make 
solving systems or finding inverses easier.
Used in:
    Solving systems of linear equations efficiently
    Numerical stability in computations
    Computer graphics, simulations

regression vs interpolation
regression			interpolation
approximate a best fix to data	exact fit through all data points
degree of polynomial is low	degree=no. of points -1
doesnt pass through all points	pass through all points
noisy/overdetermined data	exact value/small data points
