A differential equation is called nth-order if the highest derivative 
in the equation is of order n.

problem with interpolation for large data points
-runge phenomenon: large oscialltions near edge of interval
poor approximation though polynomia lpasses through all points

-numerical instability: high degress polynomial are sensistive to
small change in data values, round off errors

-computational cost: more comptation,inefficient

soltion:
-spline: piecewise polynomial interpolation
breaks interval into smaller sub intervals and fit lower degree
polynomials in each part,smooth ,avoids oscillations

-least square approximastion
when data has noise ,function is unknown
bset fit data, not exactly interpoalte
reduces error and improvecs stability
