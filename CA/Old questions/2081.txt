pipelining:
decompsoing a sequatial process into sub processes with each sub prcess
being executed in a special dedeicated segment that opertes concurrently
with aall other segments
each segment performs partial processing as specified by the way task
is partitioned. result obtained from copmutation in each segment is
transferred to next segment in pipelinle. the final result is obtained
after data has passed through all segments
a1xb1+c1 figure + table

instruction pipeline:
consecutive instructions are read from memory while previous insteructions
are being executed in other segments
instruction,fecth,execute segments overlap and perform simultaneously
fetech instruction from memory
decode instructoiun
calculate effective address
fet operands from memory
execute instruction
store result in proper place

advantages of pipelining:
increased throughput: multiple isntructions are processed simultarnouly,
increasing isntruction execution rate
efficient resource utlizaiton: aech part of processor is doing useful
work in ewaech clock pulse
improved performenace: overall performance iprovse withoutr increasing
no. of prcessor or clock speed
faster instrctuion execution: faster for sequential instruction execuion

priority interrupt:
determines whci interrupt is to eb served first when 2/more requests
are made simultaneouly
determines whcih interrupts are permitted to interrupt computer while
another is ebing serviced
higher priority interrupts can make request wihle servicing lower
prioiry interrupts

polled interrupt:
one common branch attaced for alll interrupts
program takes care of interrupts, starts at branch address and tests(polls)
the interrupt sources in sequence
the orer in which they are tested determines the prioirty of each interuppt
higher priority source is test first, if its interrupt signak is on
,control brances to ISR for this source. otherwise,next lower priotity
source is tested and so on
figure

adv:
simple
low cost as little hardwarre needed

disadv:
for large no. of io device time required to poll them can excedd time
to serve them
slower than vector interrupts since use software

vectored interrupt:
devicse are connected in a chain as shown in figure
device with highest priority is placed in 1st position followed by
lower priority devices
suppose 2/more devices interrupt prcoessor at a time, in response
processor saves its cutrernt status and generates INTA and sends to
highest priority device
if this device generated interrupt, it accepts INTA from porcessor else
itt passes to next device until INTA is accepted by the interrupotign
device
interrupt ve tor address is generated using hardware

adv:
fast as highest priorty interrupt request is identified by hardware
fast as each interrupt source has own interrupt vector to direclty
access its own service routine

disadv:
expensive 

daisy chain:
devices are connectied in a serial chain
interrupt line goes through eeach device in sequence
1st device in chain has highest priority
any device recievse INTACK signal at PI puts VAD on the bus
only the physically closest to CPU device gest INTACK and blocks the rest

adv:
faster than polling as hardware based
simple wiring

disadv:
priorites are fixed, ;less flexible
farthest device may never get servided is high prioty devces are busy

parallel priority interrupt:
all devices are connectedf to prioirty encoder
all interrupt liens are checked simultaneously
encoder indentifies highest priorty reuqest among all dewvices
generates binary code representing device to be serviced

figure:
IEN- set/clear by ION/IOF
IST- represent unmasked interrupt has occurred
INTACK- enabels buf buffer to load VAD generated by prioty logic
Interrupt Reigster:
each bit from different interrupt soruce,different prioty llevel
each bit can be cleared by program instruction
Mask Register:
associated with interrupt register
each bit can be set/cleared byu uisntruction
priority encoder truth table

adv:
fast and flexible
dyanmically programmable

disadv:
complex
explensive hardward

parity:
whne binary data is transferred through commuinicatoin medium,
external factor may cahgne bit from 0 to 1 vice versa. error detection
code is binary code that detects and corrects error during transmission
parity bit is the extra bit added to message to make total no. of 1s 
even(XOR) or odd(XNOR)
generator: generates parity bit and appends to message in sender sidew
checker: checks parity bit in receiver side and determines if error occir

instructoin format:
layout bits of machien level instruction
in 16 bit format, 3 fields
mode(1)-bit 15 specifies addresing mode (0:direct 1:indirect)

addres(12)-bit 0-11 specifies registers/locations in memory to be used for

io interface
special hardawre between CPU and peripheral to supervise sync io transfers
interface unit becasue tehy interface between processor bus and peripherals
why?
-peripherals are electromechanical/magnetic, their way of operting is
diferent from that of CPU and memory which are electronic
-data trnasfer date of peripherals is slower than that of CPU require sync
-data format of perohperals differ from that in CPU and memory
-operating modes of peripherals differ from each other and control is 
needed to not distrub the operations od other perihperals connected

programmed io:
CPU is in full control of io operation
CPU continuosly polls io device to see if ready for adta transfer
data transfer is initiated by io instrctuion written in program
all operateiions read/wrtie are carreid out under CPU supervision
flow chart 

steps:
cpu send io command to device
cpu keeps checking device status (polling)
once device is ready, data is transferred
cpu continues with next instruciot

adv: simple,little hardward
disadv: busy waiting, CPU is tied up for long time with no useful work

interrupt initiated io:
cpu inintiates io but doesnt wait/polls io device continuously
instead device interrupts cpu when ready for data transfer

adv: cpu can perform other tasks while io operation is in progress

steps:
cpu sends io command to device
cpu process with other work(no polling)
when device is readym sends itnerrupt signal to CPU
cpu suspends current excutoin and calls ISR
isr handles io data rransfer
CPU resumes previous work after sevicing interrupt

cache mapping:
technique used tp place main memory block in to cahce memory lcoation
decides where to store and how to retreive data from cache for efficieny

direct mapping:
each block of main memory maps to exactly one cache line 
not flexible
fig

shift microoperations:
shieft bit of binary data left or right
sued for serial transfer of data,bit manipulation, aritmetic operations

logical shift: 
shifts data left or right, filling vacant bit with 0
left: shiftts all bit to left, 0 inserted at rightmost bit
right: shift all bit to right, 0 inserted at leftmost bit

arithmetic:
used for signed binary numbers
sign ibt MSB must be kept same while shifting
left: same as logcial left shift,multiplies signed number by 2
right: copeis sign bit to vacant MSBdivides signed nubmer by 2

circular: serial input is the bit that is shiefted out from other end
