assumptionms of linear regression model:
-linear relationship:
relationship between dependent variable and independent variable is
assumed to be linear
checked by using scatter plt of residual vs predicted y value or
observed vs predicted y

-normality fo errors:
residuals are assumed to be norammly distributed
checked using historgram q-q plots

-independece of errors:
errors in one obs should not be related to error in another
residual vs observation order

-homoscedasticity:
variance of residuals os constant across all levels of independent var
residual vs predicted y

-no multicollienarity:
occurs when independet varialbes are highly correlated wit h each ther
didifulft to determnine unique contribution of each var to model
varaicne inflationary factor(IVF)

-no mweasurement error in predictors:
indpenednt variables should bne meausred accuirately

design of experiment:
statsitacal methdo of planning expermienst in a way data can be
analyzed to yield valid and object concluse:
-idinetify cause and effect relatiuonship bewteen varaibles
-minimize varailbilty,maziminize information
-optimize porcess/products
randomizaiton,replicaion,blocking

typ I error:
error of rejecting null hypotheisis whjen it is actually treue
prob of making type I error is significance level alpha
aplha=prob(rejct h0/h0 treue)
complementary prob 1-alpha is called confidence level

type II error:
error of accepting null hypothesis when it is actually flase
prob pf makling type II error is beta
beta=prob(accpet H0/ho false)
complementary prob 1-beta is called power

non parametric test:
statistical test that deos not assume a specific probability distribution
lik normal for population from whihc sample is drawn
based on ranks/median than means and varainces

can be used to test hypothesis that do not involve popn aprameters
less affectd by extreme vlues/outliers
do not require data to follow specific distribution like normal
more relieable for smlla sample size where normality cant bee assuemed
computationally simpler and easier to understand
can be used for ranked/ordinal data not just interval,ratio data

markov process:
random process whose future behaviuor cant be accurately predicted 
from its past behaviour excpt current behaviour and which onvoles
random probability
andrei Markov

markov chain:
discrete time discrete stat markov stochastic process
-all statwes of markov chain communicoate with each other
-not periodic(periodic is when you can only return to state in a even
no. of steps)
-doesnt drift away to inifty

queuing theory:
queuins system in context of stochastic process is a mathematical
model used tod escribe systems in which entities arrive randomyl
over time and wait in a queue to be served by 1/more servers
eg: waiting for bus,waiting in supermarkets,fast food drive thorugh

components:
-arrival prccoess:
describes fhow entities arrive at queueing system
time betweeen arrivals are assumed to be random,commonly poisson

-queueing & routing to servers:
queue is where enntites wait for their turn at service faicilty

-server mehcanism:
how customers are served after joining a queue

-queue discipline:
rule by which entities in queu are selected for service
FIFO LIFO priorty

-departure:
once service is complete, entities exit the system
may include post service feedback

partial cooreation coeff:
meausres relation between 2 varaibles whjile controlling effect of 
1/more varaibles
isolates direct association between 2 variables by removing effect
of confounding variables
1st 2nd 3rd o rder(controlled effect of 1,2,3/more var)

multiple cororelkation coeff:
closesness of assocaiton between obsdervue dof depoend variale y and
its estimated value y cap given by regreesion eqn
Ry.12
perasion's correlation coeff between y and y cap

good estimator:
-unbiasedness:
expected value equals to true value of parameter being estimated
E(theta cap)=theta
E(x bar)=mu

-efficieny:
effiecnt estimator has smallest possible vareaince amoing all
unbiased estimators of paramtere
loewr variance means mroe reliable estimates with less spread
estimator with smaller variance has more chance of prodcuing estimate
closer to true value of unknown parameter
theta 1 cap theta 2 cap, theta 1 cap ius more efficient
var(theta1)<var(theta2)
=>SE(theta1)<SE(theta2)

-consistency:
converge to true aramter as sample size increases
var(theta)->0 as n->infinity

-sufficieny:
uses all info in data relevant to paramenter
sample mean is mroe sufficent than sample median in estimating popn
mean as it ocnsiders magnitude of individual data but median only
considers its rank order
