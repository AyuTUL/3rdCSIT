lsd:
experimental design which has capacitiy to handle 2 knowwn nuisance
source of variablity imultaneously as 2 indeoedent blocking criteria
each trreamenet occurs once in each row and each column
no. of treatmenets=no.of replicaiotns

asumption:
-interaction: 
no interaction between:
treatments:different factors
blocking factors: row and column factors for c ontrolling extraneous var

-equal levels:
no. of leveles for each treament and blocking factor must be equal
4 treatments(ABCD)=4 rows 4 cloumns

-normality:
errors should be normally distributed

-homogenety of variance:
vacraince/spread of errors should be consistent across all treatment
gropus and blocks

-independece of erros:
error in one measurement should not influence error in another

linear model of lsd:
yijk=mu+alpha i + beta j + gamm k + eijk
yijk:obs in ith row jth column kth treatment
alpha i:efffect duee to ith row level of blocking factor
beta j: effect due to jth lelve of colkmun blocking factor
gammak: effect due to kth level of primary factor
eijk:random error whichi is normally distributed with mean0 and variance sig2

estimation:
process of using sample data to estimate a poluation parameter

-point:single value(eg sample mean) is used as estimate
-interval:range of values(confidence interval) within whihc parameter
is likely to lie

clt:
statistical concept that states that sample mean distribution of a 
random vraiable appraches normal distribtuin as sample size increaes
regardless of shape of original poluation distribution
sample size>=30
average of sample mean and sd is will be eual to popn mean and sd

multiple cororelkation coeff:
closesness of assocaiton between obsdervue dof depoend variale y and
its estimated value y cap given by regreesion eqn
Ry.12
perasion's correlation coeff between y and y cap

design of experiment:
statsitacal methdo of planning expermienst in a way data can be
analyzed to yield valid and object concluse:
-idinetify cause and effect relatiuonship bewteen varaibles
-minimize varailbilty,maziminize information
-optimize porcess/products
randomizaiton,replicaion,blocking

typ I error:
error of rejecting null hypotheisis whjen it is actually treue
prob of making type I error is significance level alpha
aplha=prob(rejct h0/h0 treue)
complementary prob 1-alpha is called confidence level

type II error:
error of accepting null hypothesis when it is actually flase
prob pf makling type II error is beta
beta=prob(accpet H0/ho false)
complementary prob 1-beta is called power

assumptionms of linear regression model:
-linear relationship:
relationship between dependent variable and independent variable is
assumed to be linear
checked by using scatter plt of residual vs predicted y value or
observed vs predicted y

-normality fo errors:
residuals are assumed to be norammly distributed
checked using historgram q-q plots

-independece of errors:
errors in one obs should not be related to error in another
residual vs observation order

-homoscedasticity:
variance of residuals os constant across all levels of independent var
residual vs predicted y

-no multicollienarity:
occurs when independet varialbes are highly correlated wit h each ther
didifulft to determnine unique contribution of each var to model
varaicne inflationary factor(IVF)

-no mweasurement error in predictors:
indpenednt variables should bne meausred accuirately

stochastic process:
sequqnce of random events that occur over time in some ordered fashion
model stock prioces, weather patters, bilogical systems

-discrerte time vs continuous
-markov vs non markopv
-stationary vs non
-homogenous vs non
-time dpeednet vs non
