DDA:
lien drawing algorthim to draw stragh line between 2 poitns in pixel gri
incrementally calcutes middle opsition between start and end points
using lfoat poitn arithtmetic

window to viewport transformation:
object together with window is translated to lower left corner of window
at origoin
object nad window are slaced until window has same dimensoin as viewpor
translate viewport to correct positon on screen
flowchart

liang barsly
more efficient than cohen sutherland
parametric eqns line
inequaliltites to describe range of clipping iwndow to determine
intersection between line and clip window

importance of filling algorithm
rendering cksoed shape:
seud to fill area bounded by edges
improving realism:
rendinrin soild objects by fililng interioir with color pattern
user interaction;
paint bucket tool
efficeiny:
avoilds filling maunally every pixel
regoin based operation
supports obejctd etection,pattern recognition,collison deteciton in game

VR:
technoolgy that creates immersive computer genraetd enivironemt that
users can interact with using special deveices like VR headset,glove
and controllers
simulates areal/imaginary world making user fella as if they are 
physically present in digital enviroment

non immersive:
cg envi thaht uesrs interact iwth standard screen like destop laptop
not fully immersive expreiorence but some level of ineration
flight simulatr games,3 modeilng software

fully imersei
complete virtual environent wher euser fell like they are phyiscally
inseide digital workd
speicla hardware like vr hedset,motion tracking sensor,haptic feedba
vr gaming half life alyx,beat saber,training simutakl milityra,
vr meetings

semi immersive:
mor eengaing than non but no fully replace real world like immer
large sreen to create realistic experince
flight training for pilot with multi screen,driving simultaor f1,
mdeical training

polygon table:
type of plygon surface,boundary represnetaion that uses geometric
table and attribute tables
geomtetric:vertex,edge,polygon surface table
vertext table:coordinate vleu for vertex
edge table: edges and pointer to vertex table
surac etable: surface and poitners backto edge table
attribute table: qualitative properties like degree of transparency
surface reflectivity

polygon mesh:
plygon surfac eboundary reprsentaion which is a collection of edges
vertices and pllygons connected such that each edge is shared by at 
most 2 polygons and vertex is hsared by at least 2 edges
an edge connect 2 vertics and a polygon is a closed squence of edges
triangle mesh,quadrlatearl mesh

solid modeling:
solid modeling is technique in cg to repesrnt 3d objects with well
define strctiures for operatins like rednring,collision detection
phyiscal simutlation in our compter

sweep repressnetaiton:
sweep is ued to make 3d from 2d having same symmetry
moving 2d shape laong a path in space

-translational sweepp:
2d shape in moved along straight path to geenrated solid obetc
shape is unchanged during translation

-rotaional:
2d shape in rotaed about an axis to form 3d solid instead of mov liear

boundary representation:
reprsted 3d objects using its boundary defined by vertex edge face
for constructing solid model of unusal shapes
reuqires large amount of storage

sptial partiioning reprsetation:
divides a space into smaller region for optimizing modeling
decribse objects as collection of adjoining non intersection solids
rending collsion detection ray tracing

octree:
3d quad tree
divides 3d space into 8 equal sub regions
recursivley sub divides into octants
each level of tree represnets different levl of details
each node resprsets ocatnt of space
collision detection algorithm

bsp:
dividies 3d into 2 parts repeatedly until ceratin conditons met
partiong plane is chose
objects in scene are split into front and back
process contine recursviley until each part meet srequied conds
redninr and collsion detecion efficent
visiblity determination
