how recursive algorithm uses stack to store intermediate result
when recursive function is called, ysstem automatically pushes
information onta a call stack that stores function's parameters
,local variables and return address(where to go back after 
recursion ends). when recusrion returns, the stackk pops the
stored inf and reusmes the function from where it lieft off
thus, the system stack helps to managhe multiple recursive 
calls automatically

call factorial(3)
1st fact(3) is called stack stores n=3
then fact(2) stores n=2
fact(1) stores n=1
fact(0) returns 1 immediately

stack unwinds as:
fact(1)=1x1=1
fact(2)=2x1=2
fact(3)=3x2=6

prims algorithm:
-randomly choose a vertex
-select connected vertex with least edge weight
-find all edges conencted to that vertex and choose least weigh
-if forms cyckle reject edge and find next least weight edge
