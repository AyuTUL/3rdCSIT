bezier curve:
spline generated by using set of onctrol points and polynomial func

-degree is one less than no. of control points
-always passes through 1st and last control points
-contained in convex hull defined by control opints
-convex hull ensures that polynomial smoothly follows control opnits
-blednign function is always posistive and sum is 1
-slope at the beginning of curve is along line joinging 1st 2 control
points and slope at end of line is along ilne joing last 2 opitns

convex hull:
convex polygonal boundary that encloses set of control points
imagine a rubber band is strectched around postion of control poitns
so taht they lie on perimeter or inside hull

bspline curve:
-degree odesnt depend on no. of control points,more reliable than Bez
-approximation spline curve
-provides local control thorugh control points over eaach segemtn of cu
-add/modify any no. of control points to change shape of curve
without affecting degree of polynomial
-b spilkne blending function aka basic funciotn tha combine cnotrol
points to creates mooth curve/sruface
-blending function not necessarily non zero

hermit interpolation:
charles hermite
-interpolation:curve interpolates smoothyl between control opints
-tangent control: precis control over tangent vectots at each opint
-paramteix represtnat:parameter u 0to 1
-derivatives:cnotinues 1st and 2nd derivativs
-local control: change in one segment only affect that segment
-polynomial form:cubic polynomial
