parametric test:
makes assumptions about the popn distrivutoin from which sample is darwn
assuems normal distribution of data and homogeniey of varaince
t test z test ANOVA

non prametric test:
doesnt assume specific popn distribution
data is ordinal nominal or assumption for para are violated
mann whitney u kruskal wallish h

adv:
no need to assume normal distribtuion/ equal varainces
works with small sazmple size
can be used fior ordinal/categorical data
less affected by extreme values

disasv:
less powerful
loss of info since only ranks are focused not magnitude
limited scope for comlpex experimental design

m/m/1 system:
most basic queueing model
the queueing process is a continuous time markov process with
-poisson arrivals(M):
custmoers arrive randomly at mean rate lambda A and inter arrival time
is exponential with mean rate of 1/lambda A

-exponential service time(M):
each customre is served at mean rate mu=lambda s

-single server(1): 1 server is avaible
-infinite queue capacity:no limit on customers witing
-fcfs discipline: fifo
-service times and interarrival tiems are independent

banks with one teller
customer servic desk with one employee helping customers one by one
pople arriving at bus tops waitin for single bus to pick them up
